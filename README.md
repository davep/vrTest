# README

An experiment starting out [with this
tutorial](https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/How-to-create-VR-content),
and the result is [hosted over here](https://blog.davep.org/vrTest/).

Don't ever expect this to do anything clever; this is just a "throw stuff at
Emacs and see what is fun and works" sandbox for web-hosted VR content.
